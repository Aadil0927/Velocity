## Overview
  **MonitorMe** is a new patient monitoring product from Stayhealthy Inc. This document describes high-level architecture of MonitorMeâ€™s local-standalone IT infrastructure in hospitals. It documents key requirements and features extracted from clients requirements and research on similar products on market. A software and hardware architecture that satisfies these requirements is presented in this document.

## Mission
  Stay Health Inc. is on a long journey to provide End to End support for hospitals. The company already has a two popular SaaS application **MonitorThem** and **MyMedicalData** in the market. **MonitorMe** aims to close the gap between Cloud based Saas applications to inhouse patient monitoring requirements. 

## User Journey
  **MonitorMe** has two unique user groups/Actors.
  1. Nurse Station Users / **Kiosk User**
       This user monitors patients on a monitoring screen set up at each nurses station.

       ### Nurse Station Users journey
         * User logs in to Kiosk
         * User observes the patient's vitals which rotate every every 5 seconds
         * User can review history and filter patient vitals through filters
         * User can generate holistic snapshot for a patient and upload it to 'MyMedicalData'
      
  3. On the go Users / **Mobile Users**
       This user monitors patients patients through a Push notification on a mobile app.

       ### Mobile Users Journey
         * User downloads and registers through mobile app
         * User receives alerts through push notification

## Requirements
  The architecture for **MonitorMe** must support the below requirements

  ### 1. Availability
   This is a critical system requirement as the patients needs to be monitored constantly. The system must be available throughtout the day. Redundancy must be built in for patching and maintenance activity. All the data from patient vitals must be read through a persistent queue with alteast 2 consumers for each vitals to provide redundancy.
  ### 2. Flexibility
   The design must be able to accommodate new monitoring vectors as the system grows. It is expected that newer patient monitoring technology might emerge and this must be part of the sofware design for monitoring. New monitoring metrics must be as simple a plug-n-play with minimum effort to code.
  ### 3. Security
   This is of the highest concern and a critical requirement. The patient vitals are highly confidential. The data must only be accessible to authorized user and behind a credential MFA gateway. Also the data needs to be encrypted both at transmit and rest.
  ### 4. Scalability
   This is not of much concern as we know what is the maximum number of patients to be monitored by one **MonitorMe** instance. A fixed hardware requirement is enough to meet the requirement.
  ### 5. Performance
    This is of the highest concern and a critical requirement. The system must be capable of processing, storing, analyzing and displaying huge amount of data accurately to the Medical professional. The application must be responsive enough to alert users in case of any deviation
  ### 6. Fault Tolerance
   This is of the highest concern and a critical requirement. The system must function even incase of any disruption for patient vital feeds or sofware/network/hardware glitches. Multiple redundance needs to be in place as well as code to be written such that data received, whatever the quality may be needs to be stored with metadata capturing the fault/missing data
  ### 7. Configurability
   This is one of the key features expected. The system must be highly configurable in terms of setting alerts for each patient. The alerts for vitals deviation might vary drastically based on patients age, medical history, current ailments and so on. All the parameters to monitor must be configurable.

## Design Constraints
  **MonitorMe** is an on-prem solution. All the system requirements must be met will limited hardware as there will be space/power/budget constraint. Also the hardware and software need to be maintained and updated on-site. Secure Network needs to be opened to send data to **MyMedicalData** Saas application and to push notification servers.
## High-Level Architecture
  
  ![High-Level Architecture!](/resources/images/High-Level-Architecture.png "High-Level Architecture")

  This is a user-centric architecture, user interface must be well designed with touch screens in mind for ease of use. Since the system also needs to support mobile push notification, crossplatform framework may be used to achieve the same.
  This Architecture uses a combination of Traditional/Monolithic framework for storing and displaying data, Event-based architecture for ingesting data and push notification, and Micro-services architecture for analyzing patient data.
  The different framework was decided based upon the application requirements to be hosted on Hospital site. A polyglot architecture fits the bill perfectly as we optimizing hardware based on software/system requirements.
## Component-Level Architecture

#### Sequence Diagram

## ADRs
#### ADR 1. Platform requirements
Status: Accepted
Context: The architecture needs to be hosted on dedicated servers on Hospital Premisis. 
Decision: The platform of choice a small server farm with DR replica on active-active mode. The server will be divided into multiple compute instances. Ex. VMs, Database servers, K8s Clusters
Consequences: The implementation is not expected to scale. The division of static resources into different compute/data clusters will accomodate varying architecture proposed

#### ADR 2. Communication protocol
* Status: Rejected
* Context: Using stream APIs to read patient vitals 
* Decision: [Web Stream-API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) to support streaming patient vital. This enables to build UI directly on the Browser without need to invest in native software development.
* Consequences: This method is not fault tolerant. Which is a major concern.

#### ADR 3. Data Processing Platform
* Status: Accepted
* Context: Data processing is a key requirement and needs to be done efficiently
* Decision: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is proposed to be used for data processing. Configurability can be achieved very effectively and we can scale specific data processing needs as per load.
* Consequences: This keeps the processing power optimum for data processing which can have varying load. Also since the system expected to have new functionality, adding these features is made easy.

#### ADR 4. Message Queue paltform
* Status: Accepted
* Context: In order to provide realtime data from sensors, we need a message queue platform
* Decision: A highly scalable message engine is required to read data from various sensors and deliver it to Consumers in a pesistent manner. Proposing to use the [Solace](https://solace.com/) application, as it provides multiple ways of integration streaming data. Solace also provides persistent queues and multiple consumer configs to ensure high data fidelity.
* Consequences: Ease of integration into multiple consumers and fault tolerant

#### ADR 5. Mobile App notification
* Status: Proposed
* Context: In order to provide realtime updates on the go, we need a mobile push framework
* Decision: A highly scalable message engine is required to quickly push notifications to mobile users. Proposing to use the same software [Solace](https://docs.solace.com/API/Messaging-APIs/JavaScript-API/Web-Messaging-Concepts/Web-Messaging-Concepts.htm) used for Message queues to be cost effective and ease of maintainence
* Consequences: Ease of integration into multiple endpoints for mobile and native framework.

#### ADR 6. Database requirement
* Status: Proposed
* Context: Data needs to be persisted and also encrypted.
* Decision: Any RDBMS/NOSQL DB can be user for this purpose. Proposing RDBMS to store patients vitals as the data is highly structured. It is easy to integrate into multiple data processing micro services
* Consequences: DB requirement is minimal as this need to store only 1 days data for maximum of 500 patients.
